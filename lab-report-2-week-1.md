The first thing to do is to download Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/ by clicking the download button shown below.

After downloading Visual Studio Code, your program should look like this.

Now the tricky part of the lab was remotely connecting. It's important to set your password for the account you want to remotely connect to.
Then afterwards you connect using the ssh command, with your account name followed by @ieng6.ucsd.edu

This is what should show up once you've successfully remotely connected to your account.

Now just explore the remote account with some commands. This is a list of some commands that you could use.

For part 6 of this lab you are trying to move around files using the scp command.
Here is how I did it with my accounts.

In part 7 of the lab, you are trying to generate what's called an SSH key. 
This makes it so that logging into your SSH and moving files with SCP a tad bit faster.
Here is what my SSH key looks like.

Finally, in part 8 of the lab you learn some more useful tips, such as running commands directly into your SSH account.
For example:
